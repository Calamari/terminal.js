# Terminal.js

Just a script mimicking the terminal to some extend. It is not meant to be a full fledged terminal script (although it could be, if someone wants to invest time creating the right commands, a piping method and some kind of file structure underneath). But it is more like a Command Line Interface for websites.

My personal homepage for example: [jaz-lounge.com](http://jaz-lounge.com).


## TODO

Things I might do in the future:

- *Write tests*
- js command that starts a js eval interpreter
- autocompletion support
- Regex Commands
- Basic bash scripting capabilities, like pipes and stuff
- Commands:
  - API-Testing commands?


## Want to things with it or help out?

Cool. Fork it. Make a pull request. Or talk to me. Feedback welcome.
